# Contract Analysis Agent

This project implements a Contract Analysis Agent using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to analyze legal contracts.  
It leverages **Pinecone** for semantic search and integrates LLMs like **Gemini**, **Mistral**, and **TinyLlama** for:
- Summarization  
- Clause Extraction 
- Question Answering  

Using **LangGraph**, it structures the agentâ€™s workflow as a **stateful graph of modular reasoning steps**, enabling dynamic multi-step interactions.
